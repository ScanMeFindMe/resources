Upload and add a logo to the QR code. Personalize its size and positioning

Higher error correction level allows for a bigger part of the QR code to be damaged but still be scannable. Choose higher error correction level if you plan to add a logo to the code. "Automatic" means that error correction level will be medium without logo and very high with a logo. The different error correction levels will change the appearance of your QR code.

----------

<p>The emergence of QR codes has transformed marketing. It encourages customer engagement, makes information more accessible, and adds flexibility to marketing. </p>

<p>However, a little bit of personalization can go a long way in increasing brand exposure and awareness. Adding a logo to a QR code is a step towards getting more scans, leads, and conversions.   </p>

<h2> Why Should You Add Logos To Your QR Codes?</h2>

<p>Imagine printing plain QR codes onto leaflets, product packagings, banners, and other marketing materials. While the QR codes work perfectly, they do nothing to convey your brand identity.</p>

<p>In business, it's important to increase awareness and instill brand loyalty amongst your customers. Logos are the most identifiable element that customers associate with a brand. You'll want your QR code to stand out from those printed in the plain, default format.</p>

<p>Customers associate logos with the company. By adding it to the QR code, you instill trust amongst the customers, and they'll have little hesitation about scanning it. If you're using a plain QR code, people may question if scanning the QR code is safe.</p>

<h2>Does Adding A Logo Affect QR Code Scanability?</h2>

</p>

<p>QR codes store information in segments of dots and spaces within the scannable area. When you add a logo, it occupies an area that's supposed to hold part of the encoded information.</p>

<p>The question is, will it affect the QR code's integrity in any manner?</p>

<p>If you're using  <a href="#static:url" title="QR code generator ScanMeFindMe">ScanMeFindMe</a>  to add the logo, there will not be any problem in scanning it. This is because QR codes are built with an error-correcting mechanism. Depending on the error correction level, a QR code is still readable even with up to 30% of its area covered up.</p>

<p>The trade off is that the QR codes with bigger error correction levels have a bigger “matrix”. Here is the same URL encoded with four different error correction levels: low (L), medium (M), high (H) and very high (Q):</p>

</p>

<p>Of course, you shouldn't cover critical functional elements such as the QR markers and version identifier with the logo. It is, however, generally safe to add a logo in the middle of the QR code.</p>

<p>When you add a logo to a QR code, you need to set its error correction level to the maximum, which is 30%. Our <a href="#static:url">QR code generator</a>  automatically does that for you and determines the best logo placement based on factors like QR code size and information density.</p>
