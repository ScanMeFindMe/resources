----------

<p>One of the reasons why marketers are turning to dynamic QR codes is their trackability. Unlike static QR codes, dynamic QR codes redirect users to a custom webpage when scanned. Therefore, it's possible to collect various metrics and compile them in visual formats. </p>

<h2>Why QR Code Scan Statistics Are Important</h2>

<p>If you generate a dynamic QR code on <a href="#pro">ScanMeFindMe Pro</a>, you'll be able to track key metrics that can help with your marketing.</p>

<p>Rather than merely distributing marketing materials with QR codes, you'll want to monitor engagement indicators like how many people are accessing a landing page via QR code. Or if a particular campaign is reaching its audience in major cities. </p>

<p>Without dynamic QR codes, you will have no idea if you're reaching the target audience or on the right track with conversion goals. You'll need to gather relevant statistics from <a href="#about:product">dynamic QR codes</a> and use them to improve the campaign.</p>

<p>QR code statistics show you what's working on your campaign and what's not. You'll know if you need a more intriguing design or a revamp in the overall strategy for better conversion from the numbers and charts. </p>

<h2>Which Scan Statistics Are Available On ScanMeFindMe PRO?</h2>

<p><a href="#static:url">ScanMeFindMe</a> is developed to track and store important scan metrics in real-time. You'll have access to the following statistics when you sign up for a PRO account.</p>

<h3>Total Scans</h3>

        alt="Total scans chart - QR code generator ScanMeFindMe">
</p>

<p>This chart shows the number of total and unique scans that you're getting everyday.</p>

<p>Unique scans are the number of scans done from different devices. It does not include multiple scans from the same device. </p>

<p>We use a special method where our server tags a device with a 'fingerprint' when it first scans a QR code. If the server detects a new scan with the same 'fingerprint', it is added to the total scans but not the unique scans.</p>

<p>You'll find this chart helpful when you want to know how many people are actually responding to your campaign. The unique scans will paint a clearer picture of how your campaign is performing.</p>

<h3>Scans By Months</h3>

        alt="Scans by month chart - QR code generator ScanMeFindMe">
</p>

<p>If you're running a seasonal campaign, this chart will be helpful. The numbers of scans are plotted by month. It helps identify the months that bring your business the most QR code traffic. </p>

<h3>Scans By Hour Of The Day</h3>

</p>

<p>You can also track QR scans by hours of the day. This is useful if you're running a restaurant or e-commerce where customers peak during different times. It helps to run a more targeted campaign during the peak hours.</p>

<h3>Scans By OS</h3>

        alt="Scans by OS chart - QR code generator ScanMeFindMe">
</p>

<p>Our server can also pick up which operating system the users are using when scanning the QR code. Usually, iOS and Android tend to dominate the chart as most users scan QR codes from their mobile phones. The statistics help when you're getting users to download an app for a specific OS. </p>

<h3>Scans By Language</h3>

        alt="Scans by language chart - QR code generator ScanMeFindMe">
</p>

<p>This chart will show what is the primary language installed on your clients devices. This is usually the language they are most comfortable with. This can be useful as if you find that a lot of your clients prefer French, for example, you might offer some materials in French to increase sales and popularity.</p>

<h3>Scans By Country and City</h3>

        alt="Scans by country and city chart - QR code generator ScanMeFindMe">
</p>

<p><a href="#pro">ScanMeFindMe PRO</a> also tracks scans by city and country. This is done from tracking the IP address of the mobile operator or internet service provider where the device is connected to. Do note that the geolocation chart only gives an approximate location of where the scans originated. </p>

<p>You may occasionally see scans from a different city or even country and it may seem surprising, especially if your QR code could not have possibly gotten there (for example, if it is a sticker on your office entrance). This usually means that somebody with a mobile phone from that country scanned your code while being on mobile data roaming.</p>

<h3>Last Scans</h3>

<p>This table is populated with historical scan data. You'll find the finer details of each scan such as the date, time, country, language, OS and browser. </p>
