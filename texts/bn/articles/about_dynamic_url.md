<p><span class="font-italic">'If you can't measure it, you can't improve it'</span>  -- Peter Drucker</p>

<p>The oft-repeated saying applies when you're making QR codes part of your marketing campaign.</p>

<p>If you're clueless about how many scans your QR Code generated over the past week, or which cities generated the most hits, you won't know if the campaign is on track for success.</p>

<p>Now, not all QR codes are trackable. You need to create the right QR codes and ensure that they are linked to a tracking module. Creating QR codes with ScanMeFindMe makes this very easy. </p>

<h2>Why Create Short URLs with QR Codes?</h2>

<p>A short URL is a shortened link address that redirects the user to the intended webpage. </p>

<p>For example, here's a short URL: <span class="font-italic">http://qrs.re/resources</span></p>

<p class="imageholder">
    <img src="https://media.scanmefindme.com/blog/about_dynamic_url/files/img 1 - qr.png"
        alt="Example of QR code for short URL - ScanMeFindMe">
</p>

<p>It points to our resource page, which has the full URL: <span class="font-italic">https://scanmefindme.com/en/resources</span></p>

<p>If you encode the full URL into the QR code, it will still direct users to the respective webpage. However, you wouldn't be able to tap into the full benefits that QR codes have to offer. </p>

<p><strong>QR codes that encode short URLs</strong> are also known as dynamic QR codes. With a dynamic QR code, you have more flexibility in editing the destination content and also in tracking users that scan the QR code.</p>

<h2>How To Track Views With QR Code</h2>

<p>When you generate a dynamic QR code with our <a href="#pro">PRO QR generator</a>, it is automatically linked to our tracking tools.</p>

<p>When a user scans the QR code and is redirected to the destination webpage, <a href="#static:url">ScanMeFindMe</a> traces key metrics from the device and saves them on the dashboard.</p>

</p>

<p>From the <a href="#article:about_statistics" title="Scans statistics for dynamic QR codes">statistics</a>, you will discover how many scans are generated by a particular QR code and how many of them are unique hits. Unique hits are scans generated from different devices. Often, it means different individuals are scanning the QR code. </p>

<p>Also, you'll get a monthly and daily breakdown of the scans, which helps in determining the peak hours or any distinct patterns where users frequent your website. </p>

<p>The charts help marketers to fine-tune their campaigns to increase conversion and sales. For example, an online retailer can run targeted promotions during the hours when it's anticipating peak traffic.</p>

</p>

<p>There's more to getting the number of total hits with our QR code tracker. You'll get access to details like the number of scans by OS, language, city, and country. </p>

<p>These metrics provide insights into how your campaign is faring at a deeper level. For example, if you're promoting an app developed for Android users, you'll want scans originating from the Android platform. </p>

<p>Marketers targeting the global audience can personalize their campaigns based on how users in the respective cities or countries are responding. </p>

<p>The figures help with other marketing strategies and serve as an early indicator of which region is more likely to generate an impactful engagement. </p>

<h2>Bottom Line</h2>
