----------

<p>Having a personalized QR code that captures customer's attention helps in getting more engagement. With fun colors, a catchy caption, and a logo, you'll have a QR code that resonates with your brand value.</p>

<p>Customizing QR codes can be a fun process, but it can be equally taxing if you do it every time you need to generate a QR code. </p>

<p>This is where you'll want to create presets, a feature exclusive to ScanMeFindMe PRO users.</p>

<h2>What Are Presets And Why Do You Need Them?</h2>

<p>Presets are a memory of customization you've selected or created for a particular QR code. When you're using ScanMeFindMe PRO, you get to personalize the QR code with styles, colors, <a href="#article:about_templates">templates</a>, and <a href="#article:about_logos">logos</a>.</p>

<p>These selections can be saved as a preset where they can automatically be selected and applied to a new QR code. Technically, a preset contains information on the particular choices of styles, templates, logos, and colors. Presets are valid as long as the individual elements are not renamed or deleted. </p>

<p>Here's how you can use presets to save setup time when creating a QR code. </p>

<p>You're releasing a series of yoga tutorial videos, and you're <a href="#article:about_static">encoding the links in QR codes.</a> If you're going to personalize the QR code for each episode, you'll need to manually choose the colors, logo, templates, and style.</p>

<p>It's easy to make a mistake, which results in some QR codes looking out of place. Also, you're wasting time repeating a process that can be automated. </p>

<p>By saving your choices as a preset, you can reuse the style elements by just loading the same preset when generating the QR code for each episode. </p>

<h2>How To Create And Save Presets for QR codes</h2>

<p>If you're using <a href="#pro">ScanMeFindMe PRO</a>, you can create a preset with the 'Create a new preset' button while you create or edit any QR code in the QR code generator. You can choose a name for your preset so it is easier to use in the <a href="#about:api" title="QR code API">API</a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, you can duplicate an existing preset in the library and customize it. </p>

</p>

<p>Once you're done, the customized preset will appear alongside other pre-installed presets on the selection panel. </p>

<p>Selecting a preset will automatically regenerate the QR code with the selected style and design elements. If you're using our <a href="#static:url">QR code generator</a> from the API, you can invoke the presets by specifying their names.</p>

<p>Stop re-styling your QR code each time you generate one. Try <a href="#pro">ScanMeFindMe PRO</a> and use presets instead. </p>
