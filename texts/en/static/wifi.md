<h1>[Wi-Fi] Create a QR code for a Wi-Fi connection</h1>

----------

<h2>What is WiFi QR Code?</h2>

<p>WiFi QR code is a two-dimensional barcode that allows smartphones to connect to a WiFi network automatically. Instead of choosing the right network and keying in the credentials, users can join an existing network by scanning the WiFi QR code. Using a WiFi QR code offers convenience and improves efficiency for businesses and users.</p>

<h2>How does a WiFi QR Code work?</h2>

<p>WiFi QR codes take advantage of the quick-scanning QR technology by encoding the necessary network credential in the scannable QR code. Basically, you'll need the following parameters to connect to a WiFi network:</p>

<ul>
<li>Encryption type</li>
<li>SSID (the network's name)</li>
<li>Password</li>
<li>Hidden status</li>
</ul>

<p>ScanMeFindMe WiFi QR code generator allows you to encode the information into a QR code.  Once you've filled in the necessary parameters, our tool creates a scannable QR code that you can share with trusted users. For example, you can print the WiFi QR code for your home network and share it with your family and friends.</p>

<p>To connect to a WiFi network, users scan the QR code with a smartphone and join the network when prompted. The smartphone will automatically establish and authenticate the connection with the network credentials decoded from the QR code.</p>

<h2>Is WiFi QR Code generator safe?</h2>

<p>Understandably, some users might be wary of using an online WiFi QR code generator for security and privacy concerns. If you're wondering if it's safe to turn your WiFi credentials into a QR code with our tool, it is. We can't vouch for all free QR code generators, but you're not at risk when generating a WiFi QR code with our tool.</p>

<p>ScanMeFindMe practices a strict privacy policy where we do not store, use or sell any information you've used to create a QR code. This means that we have no knowledge about your WiFi SSID and password. We strive to make QR code technologies work for you and not against you.</p>

<h2>Which WiFi encryption should I choose?</h2>

<p>Most modern WiFi routers are shipped with default WPA/WPA2 encryption. This type of encryption is the most secure as it effectively blocks unauthorized parties from misappropriating transmitted data. It is quite likely that your router is set up with WPA/WPA2.</p>

<p>ScanMeFindMe provides a choice of WPA/WPA2, WEP, and none when choosing the encryption type. WEP is an earlier form of encryption with known vulnerabilities, while choosing â€˜none' means your network is not secured with encryption. We recommend enabling encryption for your network, particularly for home and workplace connections.</p>

<h2>Does WiFi QR code work for hidden networks?</h2>

<p>Yes. By checking the option, you can create a WiFI QR code that works for a hidden network. When doing so, the QR code classifies the network status as hidden and ensures the scanning device takes appropriate measures to connect to the network.</p>

<h2>How do I create a QR code for my WiFi?</h2>

<p>ScanMeFindMe helps you create a WiFi QR code in simple steps. Here's how to get started.</p>

<ul>
<li>Choose the encryption for your WiFi network. By default, the option is set to WPA/WPA2, which is used by most routers.</li>
<li>If you're creating a QR code for a hidden network, tick the corresponding checkbox.</li>
<li>Enter the SSID (your network name) and WiFi password into the respective fields.</li>
<li>Style the QR code with colors, logos, and pre-designed templates to give it a unique impression.</li>
<li>Download the QR code in PNG or SVG format or sign up to ScanMeFindMe Pro to access more formatting options.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What are examples of WiFi QR Code applications?</h2>

<p>The ease of connecting to a WiFi network with a single scan has seen WiFi QR codes being used in different spaces. These are how you can use WiFi QR codes to improve user experience.</p>

<h3>Hotels</h3>

<p>Guests are looking forward to impeccable service quality, and fumbling over the keypad to connect to the WiFi is anything but. To improve the guest experience, hoteliers print WiFi QR codes and place them in each room to ensure guests enjoy seamless connectivity.</p>

<h3>Cafes & Restaurants</h3>

<p>It's no secret that many busy professionals bring work (or leisure) to cafes and restaurants. Besides taking orders, waiters are often inundated by requests for the in-house WiFi password. Placing WiFi QR codes at each table saves the waiters from repetitive requests and prevents human errors when writing down the passwords to the customers.</p>

<h3>Hospitals</h3>

<p>A hospital visit can be a moment of mixed feelings or requires deliberations amongst closed ones. Placing WiFi QR codes at strategic places allow visitors and patients to connect to the WiFi instantly to distract themselves or connect with loved ones. It prevents the visitors and patients from overwhelming the concierge or nurse station for a basic request of the WiFi password.</p>

<h3>Public places</h3>

<p>Some cities offer free and high-speed internet connectivity in public spaces. While this provides convenience for the locals and visiting tourists, it's essential that they can connect to the public WiFi easily. Placing WiFi QR codes at visible spots, such as transportation hubs, sidewalks, and lamp posts, helps support the public internet initiative.</p>

<h3>Workspaces</h3>

<p>Whether a new hire or clients frequent your office, they will need to connect to the workspace's WiFi network. Turning to the network administrator or IT manager for every password request is inefficient. Instead, your workspace can be more connectivity-friendly by sticking WiFi QR codes in the appropriate areas.</p>

<h3>Home</h3>

<p>If friends and family members are popping the question about your WiFi passwords much too often, it's high time to print and place a WiFi QR code in your home. This helps prevent awkward sessions of asking for WiFi passwords each time they pay a visit.</p>

<h2>How to join a WiFi network with QR Code?</h2>

<p>Joining a WiFi network with a QR code can be slightly different for different smartphones and operating systems. We'll describe how scanning WiFi QR code works for iOS and Android phones.</p>

<h3>Do I need a QR code scanner app to join a WiFi network?</h3>

<p>If your smartphone has built-in QR-scanning capability, you don't need a separate QR code scanning app. For example, iPhone users can launch the camera app and scan the WiFi QR code. However, users with older models of Android phones might need to install a dedicated QR code scanner. Thankfully, you can find many free QR code scanners on Playstore.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>Is it safe to share WiFi QR Code with other users?</h3>

<p>It depends on the situation. Sharing the QR code is akin to sharing the WiFi passwords with others. If the WiFi QR code is meant for private premises, such as homes and workspaces, you should limit who can access the network.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, public WiFi is meant to be shared by all, and there is little harm in placing the QR codes in public places. With that said, you'll need to take appropriate security measures to ensure that the network is not misused for unethical or illegal purposes.</p>

<h3>Does a WiFi QR code expire?</h3>

<p>A WiFi QR code embeds the exact network connection parameters. You can use the same QR code indefinitely as long as the router's configuration remains unchanged.</p>

<h3>Can a laptop connect to a network with a WiFi QR code?</h3>

<p>Yes. Like smartphones, laptops can connect to a WiFi network with a QR code as long as it has a functional webcam. All you need to do is install a QR scanner app, which will scan the QR code and connect the laptop to the designated WiFi.</p>

<h3>Do I need to generate a new QR Code after I've changed my WiFi password?</h3>

<p>Yes. As the QR code stores the exact WiFi password, you have no choice but to generate new QR codes. Otherwise, users will connect to the network with the old, obsolete password.</p>

<h3>Can I use the same WiFi QR Code for both 2.4 GHz and 5.8Ghz bands?</h3>

<p>No. A QR code is designed to store only one WiFi connection credential. You'll need to create two different QR codes if you need instant connectivity for 2.4GHz and 5.8GHz bands.</p>
