<h2>What are common URL QR code use cases?</h2>

<h3>Contactless dining</h3>

<p>The recent global health crisis has led to an immediate shift in how people dine in restaurants. To minimize contact, restaurants assign individual tables with a unique QR code. When customers scan the QR code, they are led to an online menu, where they can browse and place food orders from the phone.</p>

<h3>Labels and packaging</h3>

<p>Consumer products like canned foods, snacks, and dairies leverage QR codes to enhance customer experience. For example, Coca-Cola added a dynamic QR code in its <a href="https://us.coca-cola.com/support/sip-and-scan-faqs" target="_blank">Sip & Scan campaign</a>. Customers who scan the QR code are taken to a landing page where exciting rewards await. Some products use QR codes to provide users immediate access to a how-to manual, recipes, and other relevant information.</p>

<h3>Trade events</h3>

<p>Businesses have closed deals, formed strategic partnerships, and gained new clients at trade events by ensuring unimpeded access to business information. QR code allows exhibitors to share information and exchange contacts effortlessly despite immense foot traffic. They place QR codes on promotional material, including banners, brochures, booth stands, and presentation media.</p>

<h3>Scan to pay</h3>

<p>QR code is essential for digital payment technology, particularly in the APAC regions. Retailers that use the regional payment gateway generate a QR code that directs customers to a specific payment page. They place the payment QR code at the cashier, where customers can scan and transfer money to the retailer.</p>

<h3>Print marketing</h3>

<p>Despite the rapid digitization of businesses, print marketing remains influential in some industries. By adding a QR code, companies provide their customers an easy means to redeem a coupon, prefill an order, download an app, or tour a property in 3D.</p>

<h2>How To Style URL QR Codes?</h2>

<p>A plain black and white QR code works perfectly fine to send your customers to a landing page. However, adding visual appeals help in increasing views and conversions. After all, people are more likely to scan QR codes that bear a logo, colors, or style that they are familiar with.</p>

<p>These are a few options you'll have when styling your QR code.</p>

<h3>Logo</h3>

<p>You can use the many default logos on our platform or upload your own with a Pro account. Doing so instills trust amongst users when they come across your QR code. If you're wondering if adding a logo corrupts the encoded URL, <a href="#article:about_logos">it doesn't</a>.</p>

<p>QR codes are designed to be readable even if the logo covers part of the encoded information. As long as the logo is sized to a specific ratio and doesn't cover the markers at the edge, your QR code will be perfectly scannable.</p>

<h3>Captions and borders</h3>

<p>Instead of a plain QR code, style it with personalized captions and borders. Captions offer clarity about what lies ahead after the user scans the QR code. <a href="#article:about_templates">Adding a caption with ScanMeFindMe</a> adds legitimacy and encourages your customers to scan the QR code. Meanwhile, customizing the QR code with borders makes it stands out from other text and visuals in printed materials.</p>

<h3>Color</h3>

<p>Most people are accustomed to seeing black and white QR codes. However, if you have a different color scheme in mind, you can try it out with our QR code generator. Our tool allows you to use a combination of several colors within a single QR code. Despite the flexibility, bear in mind that the foreground pixels must be way darker than the background to avoid scanning issues. Some scanners can even decode inverted QR codes when background is dark and image is light but be careful with this as some of your clients may have only primitive scanning app.</p>

<h2>FAQ</h2>

<h3>How many links can I store in a URL QR Code?</h3>

<p>You can only store one link in a QR code. When a user scans a QR code, the app automatically prompts the user to the link embedded in the QR code. If you need to track several links, you must generate a unique QR code for each. This can be done effortlessly with our QR code generator, as you can manage multiple QR codes with ease.</p>

<h3>Can I change the URL after I generate the QR code?</h3>

<p>It depends on whether you're embedding the URL with a static or dynamic QR code generator. You cannot change the web URL embedded in a static QR code after it's printed. Meanwhile, changing the destination URL of a dynamic QR code is possible as it encodes a shortened version of the web page address. You can modify the destination link on the QR code generator platform without reprinting the QR codes.</p>

<h3>Do free URL QR codes expire?</h3>

<p>Free QR codes are usually static QR codes. These QR codes contain the actual webpage URL, and they don't expire. Once you print the QR codes onto your marketing material, they will last theoretically forever. However, if you use dynamic QR codes, their validity might be subjected to active subscriptions to the QR code generator service.</p>

<h3>Which are the supported formats for QR code downloads?</h3>

<p>You can download QR codes from most tools in SVG and PNG format. Our <a href="#pro">Pro</a> users have the option of downloading the generated QR codes in PDF and PS formats, as well as printing multiple codes on the same page, configuring page size and other printing options.</p>
