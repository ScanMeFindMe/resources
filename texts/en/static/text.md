<h2>How to Optimize Your Text QR Code?</h2>

<p>Generating text QR codes seems straightforward, but there are finer points that you'll want to pay attention to avoid mistakes and increase customer engagement.</p>

<h3>Stay within character limits</h3>

<p>While a QR code can store multiple folds of text information than a 1D barcode, there is a limit to its vast capacity. Be mindful to keep the text below 4296 if it contains alphanumerics or 7089 for numbers. Failing to keep the content within the permissible limit will truncate part of the text.</p>

<h3>Double-check before printing</h3>

<p>There's no going back once you print the text QR codes. This is because the QR codes are static, which encode the actual information into the structured pixelated matrix. Unlike dynamic QR codes, you can't edit the user-intended content once they are printed.</p>

<h3>Style it up</h3>

<p>Sometimes, all it takes to get your customers to scan a QR code is to create one that projects trust and legitimacy. And this means differentiating your QR code from others that look typically plain. Use ScanMeFindMe to add a touch of color, customize borders or add your brand's logo.</p>

<h3>Choose the right printing format</h3>

<p>If you need to upload a text QR code to your website, the ideal format will be PNG or SVG. However, if you're working with a graphic designer to include the QR code in brochures or banners, you'll need to download the PDF or PS format. Regardless of your choice, our tool provides flexibility in choosing and customizing diverse QR code printing requirements.</p>

<h3>Consider the minimum size</h3>

<p>Technically, there is no standard size for QR codes. However, a QR code's scannability is influenced by the amount of text, resolution, and surface area. Some older QR code scanners may also have difficulty decoding overly-small QR codes. As a rule of thumb, keep the QR code above 2 cm x 2 cm. There is no limit to the maximum size, but you must consider the proximity between the QR code and users.</p>
