<h2>What Is an Event QR Code?</h2>

<p>An event QR code is a QR code that allows users to save or share event information from a mobile phone. Instead of manually keying the event details, users scan the event QR code and save the stored information into their calendar app. Alternatively, they can email the event information to other recipients from their phones.</p>

<p>ScanMeFindMe offers a simple and intuitive QR code generator that stores the event name, start/end date and time, and location into a QR code.

<h2>What Should You Know When Generating an Event QR Code?</h2>

<p>Follow these tips to create a precise, engaging QR code that results in a high turnout for your event.</p>

<h3>Double-check for mistakes</h3>

<p>Before you print the QR code, double-check the details to ensure they are free from mistakes. You don't want users turning up at the wrong venue or date because of avoidable human errors. To be safe, try scanning the rendered QR code with your phone to ensure the correct information is stored.</p>

<h3>Choose the correct print size</h3>

<p>One of the advantages of QR codes is their flexibility. You can increase the QR code's size to fit a large event banner. Doing so will not affect the information stored within the QR code. However, you'll need to be cautious if you want to shrink the QR code's size. We recommend maintaining a minimum size of 2 cm x 2 cm as some smartphones have difficulty reading an overtly-compact QR code.</p>

<h3>Experiment with colors</h3>

<p>It is psychologically proven that using the right colors motivates users to take action. Instead of settling for a black and white QR code, use our color tools to create one that projects enthusiasm, urgency, and interest. However, it's a best practice to maintain a significant contrast between the foreground and background to ensure scannability.</p>

<h3>Upload your own logo</h3>

<p>Users might hesitate to scan on a logo that does nothing to project legitimacy. Adding your company, event, or brand logo changes that. You can use our QR generator to upload your own logo if you're on a PRO subscription. It's an indirect approach to let users feel safe when scanning the QR code.</p>

<h2>How do Businesses use Event QR Codes?</h2>

<p>Businesses in different niches use event QR codes effectively to ensure high attendance in various ways.</p>

<h3>Wedding planners</h3>

<p>Wedding planners send out invitation cards weeks before the big day. Some guests may misplace the card or forget to mark the date on their calendar. Carefully including a QR code in the cards allows the guests to save the auspicious date on their digital calendars instantly.</p>

<h3>Trade events</h3>

<p>A successful trade event relies on promotional efforts to create awareness amongst participants and guests. Whether you're spreading the word through digital or print media, adding an event QR code allows visitors to save and set a reminder for the event on their phones.</p>

<h3>Real estate agencies</h3>

<p>These agencies often hold special events to celebrate a project launch or offer potential buyers time-limited deals. Agents would distribute flyers on roadshows and public spaces or mail them the old fashion way to existing leads. By including a QR code, keen buyers can save the upcoming event on their phones without manually keying in the details.</p>
