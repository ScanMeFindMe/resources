<h1>[Contact] Create a QR code for contact information</h1>

----------

<h2>What is Contact QR Code Generator?</h2>

<p>Contact QR code generator is a software tool that allows users to create a two-dimensional barcode that contains specifically formatted contact details. Instead of manually keying in the contact details, you use a QR code scanner to automatically copy and save the contacts to your phone book from a contact QR code.</p>

<h2>What Information Can I Store in a Contact QR Code?</h2>

<p>ScanMeFindMe allows you to generate contact QR codes in 2 different formats, vCard, and MeCard. Both formats support primary fields like name, phone number, email, and website. Choose vCard if you want to store extensive corporate information, such as company, job title, or other work phone numbers in the QR code.</p>

<h3>What Should I Know About the vCard and MeCard format?</h3>

<p>vCard is a popular standard for storing contact information in a digital file. vCard is supported by a wide range of phones and applications. You can share and save vCard contacts via QR codes, email, SMS, and websites.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, MeCard is a contacts-storing file structure popularized by Domoco, a leading Japanese telco provider. MeCard can store lesser contact details compared to VCard. However, thanks to its different file structure, you can shrink a MeCard QR code to a smaller size without affecting scannability.</p>

<h2>How Does a vCard QR Code Work?</h2>

<p>vCard QR codes allow people to exchange contacts digitally from their phones. A vCard QR code contains conventionally printed information on a business card. For example, you can store your name, company, email, and phone numbers on the vCard QR code. Instead of creating a contact manually on the phone, customers scan the vCard QR code and save the underlying information automatically.</p>

<h2>Why Should I Use a Contact QR Code Generator?</h2>

<p>Marketers and businesses found contact QR codes useful for the following reasons.</p>

<h3>Efficient networking</h3>

<p>When you're attending a networking event, you want to spend every minute making meaningful connections. Turning your contact information into a sharable QR code means you don't have to spend time articulating your phone number, email, or company name to other participants. They can scan the QR code from your phone or business card and save your details immediately.</p>

<h3>Space-saving design</h3>

<p>An efficient marketing media conveys a clear and powerful message. If the contact information clutters an event banner, billboard, or business card, it's hard to get the message across. In such cases, a contact QR code generator will be handy. Instead of spelling out all the details, encode them into a contact QR code to save valuable space on the printouts.</p>

<h3>Universal usage</h3>

<p>Contact QR code, be it in Vcard or MeCard format, is not restricted to any specific group of users. You can scan and save the encoded contact details if you have a QR code scanner on your mobile phone. Also, most people are already adept at scanning QR codes, which makes sharing contacts with the technology much more effortless.</p>

<h2>How to Generate a Contact QR Code?</h2>

<p>With ScanMeFindMe, you can turn contact details into a QR code in minutes. Here's a step-by-step guide to doing so.</p>

</ol>

<h2>How to Track Views for Contact QR Codes?</h2>

<p>Tech-savvy marketers use analytics to determine if they are getting sufficient engagement through the distributed QR code. This is possible when you share a dynamic QR code instead of a static one.</p>

<p>A dynamic QR code encodes a short URL instead of the actual contact details in the QR code. When scanned, users are directed to a webpage to view and download the contact into their phone. At the same time, the website will track and log session information like demographics, language, operating system, and device.</p>

<p>Non-subscribers can generate static contact QR codes at ScanMeFindMe for free. However, a PRO subscription allows you to create trackable contact QR codes. You'll also have access to a dashboard that provides a consolidated view of real-time analytics. Learn how to view and use QR code analytics on our platform here.</p>

<h2>Preparation Guide for Generating and Printing Contact QR Codes</h2>

<h3>Double check contacts info</h3>

<p>Our free tool will get your contact QR codes generated in an instance. But do check all the fields for errors before you download and print them onto marketing mediums. Once printed, you can't edit the encoded information in the QR code.</p>

<p>There's an exception that lets you freely modify your contact details after printing the barcode. To do that, sign up to ScanMeFindMe PRO and generate dynamic contact QR codes.</p>

<h3>Ensure optimal size</h3>

<p>Before printing, ensure the QR code is sized adequately to prevent difficulty in scanning. As a rule of thumb, keep the QR code above 2cm x 2cm. If you want to scale the QR code's size to fit compact spaces, you'll have better results with the MeCard format.</p>

<p>Print a test copy and try scanning the QR code before printing in batches. Also, remember that some users might use a barcode scanner with low-resolution capability.</p>

<h3>Style the QR code</h3>

<p>With growing QR code usage amongst consumers, some users are desensitized to QR code's presence. As such, you'll need to do more with the QR code to attract a higher scan-through rate. Our QR code generator allows you to customize the QR code with templates, colors, and logos. You can create unique, catchy, and brandable QR code that attracts customers' attention.</p>
