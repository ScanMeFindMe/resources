--- Abstract / Meta description ---

Are there dangers when scanning QR codes? Or does it pose security risks to your phone? Dispel QR code myths and learn how to use them safely.

----------

<p>The rising popularity of QR codes brought along concerns of security and privacy. Hence, it's natural that you start questioning if scanning QR code is safe. Would scanning a QR code result in a hacked phone? Or invite malware programs that leak data to cybercriminals? Nobody in their right mind would want to fall victim to financial theft from scanning QR codes.</p>

<p>Instead of being consumed by unfound worries, you'll find that a QR code is nothing more than informational technology. Scanning a QR code is as safe (or risky) as clicking through an email link. By itself, QR codes will not harm your smartphone in one way or another. But that doesn't mean you should let your guard down.</p>

<p>Before diving into further explanations, it's essential to understand what happens when you scan a QR code.</p>

<h2>How Does QR Code Work</h2>

<p>QR codes hold and transfer information to smartphones. It is an encoding or representation of information in a machine-readable format. A QR code might contain a website link, phone contact, or specific command that tells your phone to connect to a WiFi network. When you dine in a restaurant, you can scan a QR code to view the menu, place an order, make payment, and leave a review.</p>

<p>While QR code is dominant in retail, the squarish space-dot pattern capable of holding various information has been prevalent in other applications. For example, trade visitors scan the QR code to save a virtual business card. Marketers embed QR codes in promotional materials that allow users to scan and download apps to their mobile phones.</p>

<p>When you scan a QR code, your phone will decode the information and tell you what the QR code contains. Then, you will be prompted to take a subsequent action associated with the QR code content. For example, if the QR code contains a link to a business website, the QR code app will ask you if you want to open the link in the browser.</p>

<h2>Is it safe to scan a QR code?</h2>

<p>The short answer is yes. It is perfectly safe to scan a QR code. The act itself does not hack, steal or erase the information stored in your phone. QR code contains website links, WiFi passwords, payment ID, and other textual information, which are used to trigger subsequent actions. The ultimate power to pull the trigger lies in the user – you.</p>

<p>Without your approval, scanning a QR code does not take you to an external website. Nor does it automatically download an app to your phone. It's also an unfound fear that QR code scans might inject malware into your phone without your knowledge. The QR code technology is not designed to compromise the phone's security.</p>

<p>While a QR code might lead you to a prefilled form on Facebook or Twitter, it doesn't install those apps on your behalf. You need to have the social media apps pre-installed to fulfill the QR code instructions. Even so, you'll have to hit the post button to publish the form, as a QR code can't override your consent.</p>

<h2>Possible risks of using QR codes</h2>

<p>QR code is technically a harmless technology, but that doesn't mean that it might not lead to risky situations. Cybersecurity threats remain a concern, regardless of whether you're accessing the internet with a QR code or other alternate means.</p>

<p>These are possible threats you'll need to be wary of.</p>

<h3>Phishing</h3>

<p>Phishing is a cybercrime that tricks internet users into revealing sensitive data such as banking passwords. Hackers do so by embedding a QR code that directs unsuspecting users to an imposter website. With their guards down, users submit their credentials to the fake site's database. Then, hackers use the stolen passwords to siphon out cash or make purchases on the actual website.</p>

<h3>Malware attack</h3>

<p>The QR code itself doesn't and cannot store malware programs. However, if you click on the QR code links without verifying their authenticity, you might be directed to a website that tricks you into downloading an infected installer. When you run the installer, your phone will be infected with malware unbeknownst to you. Often, they steal data and send them back to cybercriminals who distribute these malicious programs.</p>

<h3>Financial theft</h3>

<p>QR codes can be misused to channel payment to an unauthorized recipient. The perpetrator prints a QR code linked to their accounts and sticks it over the legit one. Users often overlook this because it's impossible to notice subtle changes in QR codes by eyes. When they pay by the QR code, the money will be wired to the hacker instead of the retailer. To prevent this, make sure that the payment page has the retailer’s name before approving the transfer.</p>

<h2>How to stay protected when scanning QR codes</h2>

<p>The trick to warding off shady websites, phishing attempts, and cyber hacking lie in taking precautionary measures after scanning a QR code. When clicking on a QR-generated link, ensure that you land on the expected destination page. For example, if you scan a QR code to visit a retailer’s Facebook page, it shouldn’t redirect you to an unknown website.</p>

<p>But clicking into a familiar-looking site doesn’t mean you’re safe either.</p>

<p>Most phishing sites are exact replicas of the original. To be safe, look for misspelled words on the URL. For example, hackers might redirect you to payment.co instead of payment.com. Also, ensure it has a padlock icon in the browser in front of the URL. The padlock icon indicates that the website uses encryption to prevent hackers from snooping on sensitive data.</p>

<p>When scanning QR codes in public places, be aware of signs that it has been tampered with. For example, a second QR code pasted on an existing one could be the work of hackers. If possible, seek clarifications from the retailer before scanning doubtful QR codes.</p>

<h2>How to generate QR codes that instill trust</h2>

<p>Despite clarifications about QR codes' safety, some people might still be wary about scanning one. If you use QR codes for business, you'll want to ensure that your QR code looks trustworthy. This means printing a plain QR code and expecting a high scan-through rate is out of the question.</p>

<p>Instead, add human-readable indicators that tell the users what is embedded in the QR code. For example, add a URL or a Facebook icon to a QR code that takes users to the business Facebook page. Print the QR code on proper material instead of sticking it over existing menus or brochures.</p>
